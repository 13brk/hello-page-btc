# Privacy Policy

## Overview

This Privacy Policy describes how hello-page-btc ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use our browser extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Information Collection

hello-page-btc is designed with privacy in mind. We do not:

- Collect any personal information
- Store any user data
- Track your browsing history
- Use cookies or similar tracking technologies
- Share or sell any information to third parties

## How the Extension Works

Our extension only:
- Displays time locally in your browser
- Shows Bitcoin prices fetched directly from public APIs
- Manages bookmarks using your browser's built-in bookmarks API

All functionality operates locally within your browser. No user data is transmitted to our servers or stored externally.
